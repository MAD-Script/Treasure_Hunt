I'm where people play; with hearts in their hands;Where diamonds and spades follow their plans.In a booth I reside; where luck is the key;Guess where I am; come find me!,
On the terrace; I stand tall and bright; A beacon of purity in the light;A vessel for blooms; I hold them with care; Look for me; I'm not hard to snare,
On the terrace; nestled in lush green;   A pot of bush; a verdant scene;   Leaves rustle softly; in the breeze they sway;   Find me here; where I stay,
At the fair; where tickets are bought;   A booth where joy is sought;   I'm waiting here; amidst the crowd's cheer;   Come find me; I'm near,
In the human button war booth; I lay low;   Amongst the fray; a hiding shadow; Round and shiny; with a thread to bind; Seek me out; I'm not hard to find,
Behind the robo soccer goal post; I hide;   A quiet spot where secrets reside;   On the field of play; amidst the action;   Look for me with keen detection,
Injured robot of robo soccer; I await;   Amongst tangled wires; a sorry state;   Power flows through me; yet I'm still;  Find me now; if you have the will,
A tree with cards; an unusual sight;   But here I am; hidden from sight;   Amongst the branches; I wait patiently;   Come seek me out; and you shall see,
On stage; where music roars; Black speakers stand; amidst the applause; Vibrations pulsate; in the air they linger; Find me here; with a pointed finger,
Under the television's watchful gaze; I'm tucked away in a secret maze; Amongst wires and cables; I make my stand;Search diligently; and you'll grasp my hand,
On the gate of the fair's grand entrance;  I'm waiting with patient obedience;  Adorned in colors; I catch the eye; Find me here; don't pass me by,
Behind the squid game's intriguing facade;    I lurk in shadows; a covert charade;   Amongst the chaos; I'm hidden from view;   Seek me out; and you'll break through,
On the black curtain; I make my mark;A hidden gem in the dark.Amongst folds and creases; I quietly stay;Find me here; don't delay,
On the old telephone; I sit and wait;A relic of times past; a nostalgic trait.Amongst buttons and dials; I'm here to stay;Search carefully; don't lose your way,
With the host of the game; I'm in plain sight;A companion throughout the night.Amongst laughter and banter; I'm part of the fun;Find me here; the game's just begun,
