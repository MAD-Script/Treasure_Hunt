I can take you to any world; But you need a special gear; I can make you feel like a bird; But you are not really there; What am I?
I am hard and heavy; But I can be broken or stacked; I can be part of a wall or a chimney; But I can also be thrown or cracked; What am I?
I am round and hollow; But I can be filled with dirt; I can be home to a flower or a willow; But I can also be moved or hurt; What am I?
I am a box that contains a VR headset; That lets you enter a virtual reality; But you need to plug me in and wear me; And you might feel sick or dizzy; What am I?
I am the brightest star in the sky; But I am not very far or high; I rise in the east and set in the west; But I never rest or sleep in my nest; What am I?
I can be smart or dumb; big or small; I can be flat or curved; hang on the wall; I can be watched in the day or night; What am I?
I am an old schooled phone; l was once used to communicate; before smartphones
I am a big lonely space where 1 am filled with irrelevant or useless things
A big red thing filled with foam to extinguish something dangerous what is it?
Nestled below a fabric sea; in darkness I conceal; Under a black sweater; a card's appeal; Discover me there; where warmth and mystery stand. Where am i?
Beneath the sleek; where Apple's magic lies; I hide beneath; a card in disguise. Flip the lid; reveal the game's start; What am I; under a Book's heart?
Beneath steel's embrace; in black and white array; A card rests silently; hidden away. Not a game of chance; but a statie stealth; Find the enigma under the steel black and white shelf; Where am i?
